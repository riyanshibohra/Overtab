# Overtab - Your Private, On-Device AI Assistant

## Inspiration
We built Overtab to solve three major challenges faced by web users: information overload (complex content), language barriers (English-only content), and privacy concerns (cloud-based AI tools). We wanted to create an AI assistant that's instantly accessible, completely private, and works for everyone.

## What it does
Overtab is a Chrome Extension that brings powerful AI capabilities directly into your browser:

üéØ **Smart Text Selection Tooltip**
- Highlight any text to explain, simplify, translate, or proofread
- Works on any webpage, any text

üåê **Multi-Language Translation**
- Instant translation to 6 languages (Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Hindi)
- 28x faster than cloud alternatives

üé§ **Voice-Powered Q&A**
- Ask questions about any webpage using voice commands
- Perfect for accessibility and hands-free browsing

üñºÔ∏è **Image Context Understanding**
- Right-click images to get context-aware descriptions
- Helps understand charts, diagrams, and visual content

üîí **100% Private**
- All AI processing happens on your device using Gemini Nano
- Zero data sent to the cloud
- No tracking, no data collection

## How we built it
Overtab is a Chrome Manifest V3 extension built with vanilla JavaScript, leveraging 5 Chrome Built-in AI APIs:

1. **Prompt API (LanguageModel)** - Powers general explanations, voice Q&A, and image descriptions
2. **Summarizer API** - Generates concise summaries and key points
3. **Rewriter API** - Simplifies complex text into plain language
4. **Translator API** - Fast on-device translation to 6 languages
5. **Proofreader API** - Grammar and spelling correction

**Technical Architecture:**
- Content scripts for text selection detection and tooltip UI
- Background service worker for sidebar management
- AI helper module for API integration
- Fallback demo mode when APIs unavailable

## Challenges we ran into
- **Multimodal Limitations**: Chrome's current Prompt API doesn't support true image inputs yet, so we built a clever workaround that extracts contextual information from alt text, captions, and surrounding page content
- **API Availability States**: Handling different availability states (readily, after-download, downloadable) for language model downloads
- **Performance Optimization**: Managing AI session lifecycle to prevent memory leaks
- **UX Design**: Creating a non-intrusive tooltip that appears only when needed

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **5 APIs in 1 Extension**: Successfully integrated all major Chrome AI APIs in a cohesive, useful application
- **Privacy-First**: Achieved complete on-device processing with zero cloud dependencies
- **Fast Performance**: Sub-2-second responses for most operations, under 1 second for translations
- **Accessibility**: Voice commands and text simplification make the web more accessible
- **Global Impact**: Multi-language support breaks down barriers for non-English speakers

## What we learned
- Chrome's Built-in AI APIs are incredibly powerful and fast
- The Translator API is 28x faster than using the Prompt API for translation
- On-device AI can match cloud AI quality while being instant and private
- Proper session management is crucial for performance
- Graceful error handling enhances user trust

## What's next for Overtab
- **Writer API Integration**: Add AI-powered writing assistance for emails and documents
- **More Languages**: Expand translation support as Chrome adds more language pairs
- **True Multimodal**: Add image analysis when Chrome's Prompt API supports visual inputs
- **Customization**: Let users customize tooltip actions and create workflows
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add power-user keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Show users how much time they've saved and languages they've learned
